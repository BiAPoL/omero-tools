# Omero-tools

This repository contains a collection of tools for working with OMERO. Such tools can be working with the OMERO command line interface to [transfer datasets between repositories](OMERO.transfer_dataset), etc. If you find anything to be missing, please feel free to contribute to this repository or open an issue.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have any suggestions or improvements. To build the jupyter book on your local machine, you can use the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r jupyter-book
jupyter-book build docs
```

## Other resources

The tutorials in this repo limit themselves on how to interact with OMERO through the Python API. However, there is a myriad of other clever and convenient ways of working with OMERO:

- The local OMERO client [OMERO insight](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/downloads/)
- The OMERO web client
- The OMERO command line API

Additionally, there are a number of other resources you might find useful:
